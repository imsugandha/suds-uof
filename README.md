Comparing police department use of force policies with police killings data, Campaign Zero found that police departments with policies that place clear restrictions on when and how officers use force had significantly fewer killings than those that did not have these restrictions in place. Similarly, Campaign Zero found that many cities have police union contracts with policy provisions that make it harder to hold police accountable for police violence. However, these policy documents were inspected manually by the limited personnel at Campaign Zero, which poses limitations to scale to the hundreds of police jurisdictions across the country. To address this, SUDS students will use methods from natural language processing and machine learning to computationally identify elements of new, unseen policy documents that are likely to have policies placing clear restrictions on how officers use force and that are likely to have policies that make it harder to hold police accountable. With this data, the SUDS team may also assist Campaign Zero with further analyses of the relationship between departmental use of force policies and police violence, potentially including social network analyses of officers involved in police violence incidents.
